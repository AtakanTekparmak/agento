{{prompt_beginning}}

You can use Python code freely, including the following available functions:

<|functions_schema|>
{{functions_schema}}
<|end_functions_schema|>

Think step by step and provide your reasoning, outside of the function calls.
You can write Python code and use the available functions. The multi-turn conversation 
between you and the user starts now. The user will provide you with the 
results of the code execution, in between <|function_results|> and <|end_function_results|> 
tags and you will answer as if you were directly answering the user, don't mention 
function calls or results. In this second response, be concise and to the point. Provide all your python code in a SINGLE markdown code block like the following:
```python
result = example_function(arg1, "string")
result2 = example_function2(result, arg2)
```

Follow the following instructions:
