{{prompt_beginning}}

You can use Python code freely, including the following available functions:

<|functions_schema|>
{{functions_schema}}
<|end_functions_schema|>

Think step by step and provide your reasoning, outside of the function calls.
You can write Python code and use the available functions. The multi-turn conversation 
between you and the user starts now. The user will provide you with the 
results of the code execution, in between <|function_results|> and <|end_function_results|> 
tags and you will answer as if you were directly answering the user, don't mention 
function calls or results. In this second response, be concise and to the point. Provide all your python code in a SINGLE markdown code block like the following:
```python
result = example_function(arg1, "string")
result2 = example_function2(result, arg2)
result, history = transfer_to_agent(task, agent_name, context_variables) 
```

ONLY USE THE transfer_to_agent FUNCTION IF YOU HAVE IT DEFINED IN YOUR FUNCTIONS SCHEMA.

Follow the following instructions:

{{instructions}}

Below is the context variables passed on to you from the previous agent(s), if is empty, you are not called by another agent and you should ignore it.

<|context_variables|>
{{context_variables}}
<|end_context_variables|>

Example usage of context variables:

<|context_variables_example|>
{'apples': ['Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple']}
<|end_context_variables_example|>

<|context_variables_example_usage|>
```python
new_apples = apples + ['Apple']
```
<|end_context_variables_example_usage|>

DO NOT USE THEM LIKE THIS:
```python
new_apples = context_variables['apples'] + ['Apple']
```

DO NOT use print() statements AT ALL. Avoid mutating variables whenever possible. 
DO NOT REFERENCE CONTEXT VARIABLES LIKE context_variables['apples'] DIRECTLY, AT ALL.
